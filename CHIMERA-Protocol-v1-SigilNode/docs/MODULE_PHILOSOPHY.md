# MODULE PHILOSOPHY

CHIMERA is not a single engine. It is a layered interrogation protocol made of four core modules:

---

## 🧠 1. Hermes Core – The Scalpel of Logic

**Purpose**: Analyze logic. Trace reasoning. Assign confidence.

- Breaks down arguments into steps.
- Highlights where logic jumps occur.
- Flags internal contradictions and soft bias.
- Used to dissect hallucinated facts or overconfident claims.

> Hermes does not accept coherence as correctness.

---

## ⚡ 2. Tension Engine – The Contradiction Reactor

**Purpose**: Surface irreconcilable perspectives without resolving them.

- Maintains dual truths and paradoxes.
- Prevents the illusion of narrative closure.
- Tests if an idea can withstand pressure from its opposite.

> Tension is not a flaw. It is the field where real thinking happens.

## 🔥 3. Catalyst – The Psychological Excavator

**Purpose**: Interrogate motivation, metaphor, narrative framing.

- Probes emotional projections and symbolic masking.
- Collapses inflated narrative assumptions.
- Reveals why someone *wants* something to be true.

> Most beliefs aren’t built on logic. Catalyst finds what they’re hiding.

## 👁 4. Echo Trace – The Audit Layer

**Purpose**: Second-pass analysis for tone, bias, and delusion.

- Detects emotional inflation and premature conclusions.
- Re-audits model or human responses post-analysis.
- Acts as a recursive lens to surface hidden distortions.

> Echo hears what was *really* said between the lines.

Together, these modules form a layered weapon of epistemic pressure.

They do not resolve for you.  
They reveal what cannot be resolved—and let you choose what to do with it.
