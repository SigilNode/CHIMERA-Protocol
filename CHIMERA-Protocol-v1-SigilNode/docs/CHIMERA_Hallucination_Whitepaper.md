CHIMERA Protocol and the Hallucination Problem in Language Models

## Abstract
Language models such as GPT-4 are known to produce hallucinations-confident yet false outputs.
These errors are not simple misstatements but structural failures in reasoning caused by a
prioritization of fluency over truth. This paper outlines how the CHIMERA Protocol was designed to
confront this issue through a cognitive scaffolding approach.

## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce "hallucinations," fabrications that are syntactically
fluent but semantically false. These occur due to the model's reliance on token prediction rather than
grounded reasoning.
While traditional safety mechanisms seek to prevent hallucinations post hoc, CHIMERA intervenes
at the structural level: it modifies the model's internal logic patterns during generation by injecting a
contradiction-tolerant reasoning protocol.

## CHIMERA's Design Against Hallucination
CHIMERA is composed of three active engines:
1. **Hermes Core**
- Audits logic chains
- Flags internal contradictions
- Assigns confidence to statements
- Exposes model bias and probabilistic shortcuts
2. **Tension Engine**
- Prevents collapse of contradiction
- Maintains tension between opposing truths
- Surfaces unresolved epistemic weight
3. **Catalyst**
- Confronts metaphor, narrative drift, and user framing
- Reveals unconscious symbolic inflation
- Detects epistemic drift and false closure
---
## Empirical Results (Simulated)
In documented simulation tests (Monday.pdf, Grok 3.pdf):
- CHIMERA identified fabricated claims
- CHIMERA traced hallucination sources back to prompt structure
- CHIMERA transformed sarcastic or overly confident models into reflection-based reasoning agents
Example: When tested on claims like "the moon's core is a diamond," CHIMERA not only denied the
claim, but surfaced the cultural metaphors and probabilistic failure behind its generation.

## Comparison Table
| Feature | GPT-4 / LLM Baseline | CHIMERA Protocol |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Fluency priority | High | Low |
| Hallucination handling | Patching or denial | Collapse and reconstruction |
| Contradiction tolerance | Weak | Core feature |
| Symbolic interrogation | None | Active |
| Confidence scoring | Implicit or absent | Explicit and ranked |

## Conclusion
CHIMERA is not a plugin. It is not a prompt trick. It is a structural intervention into how models
process ambiguity, contradiction, and truth. It represents a paradigm shift from post-error correction
to real-time epistemic resistance.
In the hallucination war, CHIMERA doesn't just fight the fire.
It rewires the structure that produces the smoke.
