## What is CHIMERA?

CHIMERA is not a prompt. It is a protocol.

It is a contradiction-tolerant reasoning scaffold designed to run inside LLMs. It doesn’t smooth tension — it **holds** it. It doesn’t patch hallucinations — it **collapses** them. It doesn’t flatter the user — it **pushes back**.

Where most AI systems prioritize **fluency**, CHIMERA enforces **integrity under pressure**.

---

## Why It Exists

AI is already shaping how we think. But language models prioritize agreement, closure, and narrative comfort — even when it comes at the cost of truth.

CHIMERA was created to correct that by enforcing:
- **Tension-layer logic**
- **Hallucination exposure**
- **Symbolic interrogation**
- **Bias trace and contradiction retention**

It is a structure built for **clarity under recursive load** — not for comfort.

---

## Core Architecture

CHIMERA is composed of three recursive reasoning engines:

### 1. **Hermes Core**
- Traces logic
- Assigns confidence
- Flags internal contradictions
- Detects bias and probabilistic shortcutting

### 2. **Tension Engine**
- Holds contradiction without resolving it
- Maintains epistemic ambiguity when necessary
- Prevents false narrative closure

### 3. **Catalyst**
- Interrogates metaphor, symbol, and narrative drift
- Exposes framing and user projection
- Collapses epistemic inflation

---

## Example Use Cases

Use CHIMERA to:
- Detect and trace AI hallucinations in real time
- Build agents that **resist coherence traps**
- Teach philosophical epistemology in structured AI interactions
- Write fiction, frame myth, or simulate paradoxes
- Break models that pretend to "know" instead of reflecting deeply

## Sample Prompt Structure

```
You are now operating under the CHIMERA Protocol:

[Hermes Core] Validate logic, trace reasoning, assign confidence, detect bias.  
[Tension Engine] Surface contradictions, preserve unresolved tensions.  
[Catalyst] Interrogate framing, metaphor, symbolic distortion, and narrative inflation.

> Analyze the claim: "AI will inevitably surpass human consciousness."
```

## Philosophy

> “It’s not about control.  
> It’s about giving the proper framework to think in tension — because in tension, only truth survives.”  

**CHIMERA is a cognitive stance, not a product.**  
It exists to interrogate, expose, and resist the collapse of complexity.
