CHIMERA Protocol v1.0

CHIMERA is a modular prompt framework for epistemic pressure and belief interrogation within large language models.

---

[1] HERMES CORE
- Logical validation
- Step-by-step reasoning trace
- Confidence flagging
- Bias and shortcut detection

Hermes: Analyze this claim...
Hermes: Break this reasoning down...

---

[2] TENSION ENGINE
- Contradiction exposure
- Dual-perspective maintenance
- Closure resistance

Usage:
Tension Engine: Hold contradiction between X and Y
Tension Engine: Destabilize this narrative...

---

[3] CATALYST
- Metaphor interrogation
- Narrative deconstruction
- Framing and symbolic analysis

[4] ECHO TRACE
- Second-pass audit

Execution Framework:

1. Isolate the target (claim, persona, model, belief).
2. Invoke modules as needed — one or in sequence.
3. Do not resolve contradiction unless instructed.
4. Report pressure points, paradoxes, and insight.
5. Preserve tension. Refuse flattening.

CHIMERA is not designed for comfort.
It is designed for pressure.
